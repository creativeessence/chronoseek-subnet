# All Bittensor subnet knowledge is in @knowledge/
# Start with @knowledge/INDEX.yaml for task routing

# Quick reference:
# - ALWAYS load subnet.invariants.yaml first (non-negotiable rules)
# - Use design_flow.yaml to select mechanism pattern
# - Pattern files: compute_auction, capacity_market, data_indexing,
#   prediction_market, time_series_forecasting, external_activity_verification,
#   adversarial_red_blue, container_execution
