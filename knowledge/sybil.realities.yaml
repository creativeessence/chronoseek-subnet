# Sybil Attack Realities
# Critical truths about identity and sybil resistance in Bittensor

core_truth:
  coldkeys_not_sybil_proof:
    rule: "Coldkeys are NOT sybil-proof"
    reason: "Anyone can create unlimited coldkeys"
    implication: "No identity system exists in Bittensor"

common_mistake:
  coldkey_deduplication:
    pattern: "one best hotkey per coldkey"
    belief: "prevents sybil attacks"
    reality: "attacker creates more coldkeys"
    status: INEFFECTIVE_FOR_SYBIL

actual_sybil_protection:
  mechanism: "256 UID slots + dynamic registration costs"
  
  how_it_works:
    1: "fixed UID slots per subnet (typically 256)"
    2: "registration cost rises with expected rewards"
    3: "miners pay proportional to expected returns"
    4: "creates economic equilibrium"
  
  uid_pressure:
    definition: "demand for slots = registration cost"
    high_pressure:
      cause: "high expected rewards"
      effect: "high registration cost"
    low_pressure:
      cause: "low expected rewards or hard to mine"
      effect: "low registration cost"

design_implications:
  DO_NOT:
    - rely_on_coldkey_dedup_for_sybil_resistance
    - assume_identity_verification_exists
    - trust_single_coldkey_means_single_entity
  
  DO:
    - design_so_N_miners_not_Nx_more_profitable
    - accept_uid_pressure_as_primary_mechanism
    - understand_registration_economics

subnet_specific:
  steep_learning_curve:
    effect: "low UID pressure"
    reason: "hard to mine profitably"
  
  easy_to_mine:
    effect: "high UID pressure"
    reason: "high registration costs"

formula:
  equilibrium: "registration_cost ≈ expected_reward_per_slot"
  sybil_deterrent: "cost_of_N_slots > reward_from_N_slots"

coldkey_dedup_purpose:
  actual_use: "prevent same-entity multi-hotkey gaming"
  NOT_for: "sybil resistance"
  limitation: "trivially bypassed with new coldkeys"

bottom_line:
  rule: "Design mechanisms where N miners isn't N times more profitable"
  dont: "Rely on identity-based sybil resistance"
