# Trust Assumptions
# What can and cannot be trusted in the Bittensor ecosystem

validators:
  individual_trust: false
  rule: "Validators are NOT individually trustworthy"
  
  attacks_that_will_happen:
    secret_sharing:
      description: "validator shares eval data with own miners"
      visibility: invisible
      certainty: "will happen on valuable subnets"
    
    weight_manipulation:
      description: "validator gives high weights to own miners"
      detection: "cross-reference validator/miner coldkeys"
      mitigation: "stake-weighted consensus dilutes"
  
  what_prevents_abuse:
    stake_weighted_consensus: "dilutes single actor influence"
    economic_incentives: "validators earn through accurate evaluation"
    consensus_mechanism: "outlier weights have reduced impact"

secret_eval_sets:
  trustworthiness: false
  rule: "Any secret held by validators WILL leak"
  
  attack_pattern:
    1: "validator maintains secret test set"
    2: "validator runs own miner"
    3: "validator shares test set with miner"
    4: "miner optimizes specifically for test set"
    5: "honest miners who do real work lose"
  
  why_undetectable:
    - private_communication
    - same_entity_different_keys
    - no_audit_mechanism
  
  conclusion: "Never rely on validator-held secrets"

similarity_detection:
  reliability: false
  rule: "Similarity detection is easier to evade than enforce"
  
  evasion_methods:
    models: "fine-tune few steps, changes weights, preserves capability"
    outputs: "paraphrase, add noise, format changes"
  
  economics: "if evasion cheaper than honest work, rational miners evade"
